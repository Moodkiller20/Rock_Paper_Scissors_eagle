Rock, Paper, Scissors…and Eagle

Rock, Paper Scissors is a famous hand game played between two people. It is often used as a method to make a fair decision between two people rather than flipping a coin or drawing straws. A full description of the original game and its history can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors

The new version of this game will include the option to play an Eagle
in addition to Rock, Paper and Scissors. While the Eagle has special powers, you can take a big hit
in points if you lose when you play an Eagle.



Rules of the Game
You will be playing against the US Eagle (the computer). The round consists of 3 games and the
winner with the most points after the 3 rounds wins. Here are the rules of the game:
• The game consists of 3 hands.
• The winner with the most points after 3 hands wins.
• TheUS and the user start each game with 0 points each.
• A hand consists of the user making a selection and The US randomly making a selection.
